## Summary
The code used to get the election results can be modified to work for any election. The code can be modified from County to district to city and even zip code. Another way this code can be modified is when voting on statewide measures that are a yes or no vote, the commission would be able to get a breakdown of what counties approved or disapproved state wide measures.
